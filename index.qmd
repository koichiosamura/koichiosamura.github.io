Hello!

I am a doctoral candidate in Political Science at the University of Vienna. 
My research interests include legislative behavior, coalition politics, and political parties. 
I am particularly interested in the coalition politics in multiparty presidential systems, but also on learning new techniques related to quantitative text analyses.

I like spending my (rare) free time testing which color pallet fits the best for my ggplots, and I always end up frustrated -- with the time I wasted on it, and because papers will end up being in grayscale anyway.
