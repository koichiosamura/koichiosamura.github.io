    "text": "Hello!\nI am a doctoral candidate in Political Science at the University of Vienna. My research interests include legislative behavior, coalition politics, and political parties. I am particularly interested in the coalition politics in multiparty presidential systems, but also on learning new techniques related to quantitative text analyses.\nI like spending my (rare) free time testing which color pallet fits the best for my ggplots, and I always end up frustrated – with the time I wasted on it, and because papers will end up being in grayscale anyway.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Contact:\nkoichi.osamura[at]univie.ac.at\nUniversity of Vienna\nDepartment of Government\nRooseveltplatz 3,\n1090 Vienna, Austria"
